# Arrow-kt Playground

## Overview

This repo contains a basic Kotlin project that can run Arrow examples. I use it to experiment, learn and share.

## The examples

### Either

The `EitherExample` file contains an example about `Either`. I know, you didn't see that coming, did you?

* Wikipedia page about [Either](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_type)
* Arrow Either [doc](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/apidocs/arrow-core/arrow.core/-either/)

### Optics

The `LensExample` file contains an example about `Lens`. I know, surprises never end here.

* My article about [Lens](https://ivanmorgillo.com/2020/10/28/how-to-fix-the-pain-of-modifying-kotlin-nested-data-classes/)
* Arrow Lens [doc](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/optics/lens/)

### Refined Types

The `refinedtypes` package contains example for… wait for it… refined types. Yep!

* Arrow [doc](https://arrow-kt.io/apidocs/arrow-refined-types/arrow.refinement/)
